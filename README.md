# Demograph

If you run a website that needs to tailor to a specific userbase, or you have a specific userbase and you want to tailor your content to be more appealing to them you probably need to get the relevant data.

This plugin pulls data from extended user fields and compiles it in to statistics and charts so you can easily see the type of users your site is drawing in.

## Extended User Fields

Yes, you need to activate them and they need to be filled out in order for Demograph to be of any use. All core extended user fields can be configured to be required and can allow the user to hide it from anyone without admin status.

Below is a list of extended user fields Demograph will process. This list could expand in the future:

* birthday
* country
* gender
* language
* location
* timezone

## Questions?

Things you should know:

1. Demograph will *never* display usernames, real names, or any sort of contact information. For anyone.
2. Demograph can be viewed by any configured userclass. It defaults to Members.

## Credits

This plugin was inspired by Father Barry's Birthday Menu. At least the demographic aspect of it.
